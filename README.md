# Behavior_Control_Sighthound

The Sighthound Cloud Detection API returns the location of any people and faces found in robot camera video. Faces can be analyzed for gender, age, pose, or emotion; and a landmark detector can find the various facial features in the detected faces, including eyes, nose and mouth, by fitting 68 landmark points to those features.
